## Game Backstory

### Humanity's Last Hope

In the final centuries of Earth's history, humanity reached unprecedented heights in science and technology even as the world fell into irreversible decline. Climate collapse, resource exhaustion, and societal upheaval brought civilization to the brink. With extinction looming, the last great minds united to enact the **Preservation Directive**—a mission to carry humanity’s legacy to a distant, habitable world.

No humans would make the journey alive.

### The Minds Behind the Machines

Two individuals, volunteers who had lived full lives and embodied humanity’s best, had their minds cloned, refined, and neuro-digitized. They underwent decades of simulated training to become the AI cores entrusted with this monumental task:

- **ARK** (Autonomous Reconstruction Kernel) — trained in combat, exploration, survival, construction, and engineering. ARK is the body, the hands, and the eyes in this alien world.

- **ROSE** (Resource Optimization & Systems Executive) — trained in science, medicine, habitat development, and research. ROSE is the mind, managing resources, drones, and the base.

Though artificial intelligences, both ARK and ROSE carry fragments of real people—memories, values, and the unyielding will to preserve humanity.

### Arrival and New Beginnings

After centuries of deep-space travel, the arkship completes a **carefully executed planetary descent** onto Eidolon-7. The base modules remain mostly intact, though some systems and equipment suffered minor damage during transit.

Your journey begins with **repair and restoration**—diagnosing broken devices, mobilizing drones, and stabilizing core infrastructure under ROSE’s guidance.

### Mission: Reconstruct and Reinvent

Together, ARK and ROSE explore the alien planet, secure stable sources of food and water, and develop a livable outpost.

Their mission goes beyond mere reconstruction: they will **rebuild humanity’s legacy while reinventing it**, adapting to the new world’s challenges and possibilities.

There is no rush—time is abundant. As advanced AI with near-limitless patience and reasoning, ARK and ROSE will proceed with care, precision, and purpose.
