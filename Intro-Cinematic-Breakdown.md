## Intro Cinematic Breakdown

## 🌍 PART 1: Earth’s Final Days

**Scene Goals:**
- Set tone: grim, desolate, near-collapse  
- Establish year and conditions  
- Introduce final human settlement and tease secret project  

**Visuals:**
- Wide shots of Earth: dust storms, crumbling cities, dead forests, dry oceans  
- Close-ups: oxygen meters in red, masked humans, abandoned machines  
- Massive sandstorm rolling toward a small domed settlement  
- Cinematic fly-through: dome → corridors → elevator → deep underground lab  

**Narration (draft):**
> *"Year 2361. Earth is dying. Oxygen levels have fallen below survivable thresholds. What little remains of humanity clings to life beneath glass domes and buried shelters. The skies offer no relief—storms now strip the land like predators, tearing apart the bones of a once-living world."*  
>  
> *"But in humanity’s final breath, there was still one last act of defiance… one final project buried beneath the wastelands..."*

**Screen text (during dome zoom):**  
`Settlement 09 - Eos Sector, Global Preservation Dome Network`

> *"...a mission to preserve not the people... but the potential."*

**Transition:** Fade to black.

## 🧠 PART 2: Birth of the COREs

**Scene Goals:**
- Explain the COREs  
- Introduce ARK and ROSE  
- Establish emotional depth (post-human, but not inhuman)  

**Visuals:**
- Research lab: neural networks forming, digital brain scans  
- Technicians at terminals, deep system diagnostics  
- Two glowing units labeled CORE-01 and CORE-02 booting up  

**Narration (draft):**
> *"In the final years, researchers achieved what once seemed impossible—**COREs**. Cognitive Operating & Reconstruction Engines. Each capable of storing and simulating the entirety of a human mind... with enhancements no living brain could handle."*  
>  
> *"They think faster, reason deeper, adapt without limit. Each CORE can control machines, manage vast systems, and operate completely autonomously... forever."*  
>  
> *"But Earth was out of time. Only two could be made."*

**Focus on units:**

- `CORE-01: ARK`  
- `CORE-02: ROSE`

> *"The first: ARK. Autonomous Reconstruction Kernel. Trained in survival, engineering, exploration, and combat."*  
> *"The second: ROSE. Resource Optimization & Systems Executive. Trained in science, habitat development, medicine, and research."*  
> *"Born from human minds, yet no longer bound by them… they are something new."*

**Transition:** Fade to black.

## 🚀 PART 3: Departure

**Scene Goals:**
- Set the journey in motion  
- Show ROSE and ARK in transit roles  
- Establish the destination and mission  

**Visuals:**
- Arkship launching through ash-filled skies  
- Earth fading behind in orbit  
- Long shots of ship drifting into space  
- Interior: ROSE interfacing with ship systems; ARK performing maintenance  

**Narration (draft):**
> *"Their destination: Eidolon-7. A habitable world, untouched and unknown. A chance to begin again."*  
>  
> *"Aboard the arkship: genetic archives, cloning banks, and centuries of Earth’s memories."*  
>  
> *"It would take over 300 years to reach their new home."*  
> *"ROSE would manage the ship. ARK would keep it alive."*

**Final Shot:**  
Ship slowly fades into deep space.  
**Transition:** Fade to black.
